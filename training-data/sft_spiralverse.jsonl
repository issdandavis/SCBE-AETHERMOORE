The codex treats the Everweave origin logs as the immutable cryptographic seed of the Spiralverse: every linguistic element is either directly attested in those logs or deterministically derivable from them. No downstream document may contradict the seed. The analogy is precise: just as a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase deterministically generates an entire wallet hierarchy, the Everweave logs deterministically generate the Spiralverse's linguistic, magical, and narrative architecture.", "metadata": {"source": "scbe_aethermoore", "version": "3.3.0", "author": "Issac Davis", "origin": "spiralverse_codex"}}

The Runic Layer (Outer Ring) assigns each of the 24 letters a symbolic concept -- for example, the rune Kor represents Knowledge, Learning, and Secrets. The Particle Layer (Inner Ring) governs spoken grammar, where the morpheme 'kor' functions as 'heart, core, essence.' The compound Kor'aelin therefore means 'Heart-Eternal' at the particle layer while simultaneously encoding 'Knowledge-Script' at the runic layer. These layers are complementary encryptions of the same key, readable at different rings of context. This dual-layer architecture demonstrates the Spiralverse's core principle: unity through difference.", "metadata": {"source": "scbe_aethermoore", "version": "3.3.0", "author": "Issac Davis", "origin": "spiralverse_codex"}}

{"id": "sft-sv-082", "category": "tokenizer-alignment", "instruction": "How does the 256-token bijective alphabet work for each sacred tongue?", "response": "Each of the six sacred tongues is assigned a bijective 256-token alphabet in the SCBE-AETHERMOORE tokenizer. The alphabet is constructed from 16 prefixes crossed with 16 suffixes, producing exactly 16 x 16 = 256 unique tokens. This maps one-to-one with the 256 possible byte values (0x00 through 0xFF). The bijection means every byte has exactly one corresponding token in each tongue, and every token corresponds to exactly one byte. This design ensures deterministic encoding and decoding, and because all six tongues share the same underlying byte space, cross-translation is guaranteed to preserve byte values.", "metadata": {"source": "scbe_aethermoore", "version": "3.3.0", "author": "Issac Davis", "origin": "spiralverse_codex"}}

Higher-weight tongues carry greater raw power but also greater risk: Kor'aelin's risk is semantic wounds from forced usage, while Draumric's risk is corruption to subjugation from non-collaborative dominance.

The Dual-Layer Key Principle shows how the same symbol (e.g., Kor) carries different but complementary meanings at different layers -- Knowledge at the runic layer, Heart at the particle layer -- unified in a single key. The six sacred tongues represent radically different modes of expression (from Kor'aelin's collaborative binding to Umbroth's productive severance) yet are unified through golden-ratio weights and unit-circle phase distribution. The tokenizer's cross-translation byte preservation ensures that different encodings preserve identical underlying meaning.

The six sacred tongues provide the tokenizer's encoding substrate, where each tongue's bijective 256-token alphabet enables deterministic, cryptographically attested data representation. The golden-ratio weights and unit-circle phases provide the mathematical structure for the framework's harmonic scaling properties. The GeoSeal envelope (with SHA-256, HMAC, phase delta, and weight ratio attestation) connects the linguistic layer to the security layer.
