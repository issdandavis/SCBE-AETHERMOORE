{"id": "sft-hydra-003", "category": "governance", "instruction": "How does HYDRA achieve Byzantine fault tolerance?", "response": "HYDRA achieves Byzantine fault tolerance through its Spectral Governance layer (Layer 5). With n=6 agents (one per Sacred Tongue), the system requires a 4/6 quorum for consensus, following the BFT formula n >= 3f + 1 where f=1 is the maximum number of tolerated malicious agents. This means the system can tolerate one fully compromised or malicious agent while still reaching correct consensus. The governance layer includes crash fault tolerance and right-shift detection (detecting when an agent's behavior drifts from its expected pattern). Combined with Graph Fourier Scan Statistics (GFSS), the system can also detect multi-agent collusion — when two or more agents coordinate to subvert the consensus.", "metadata": {"source": "scbe_aethermoore", "version": "3.3.0", "author": "Issac Davis", "origin": "hydra_architecture"}}
{"id": "sft-hydra-004", "category": "governance", "instruction": "What is Graph Fourier Scan Statistics (GFSS) in HYDRA?", "response": "Graph Fourier Scan Statistics (GFSS) is HYDRA's anomaly detection system operating at the Spectral Governance layer (Layer 5). GFSS performs Graph Fourier transforms on the agent interaction graph to detect anomalous patterns that indicate collusion or compromise. In the frequency domain, normal agent interactions produce expected spectral signatures — when agents collude or behave maliciously, they create distinctive spectral anomalies (abnormal energy concentrations at specific graph frequencies). GFSS continuously monitors these spectral patterns and flags deviations that exceed governance thresholds. This works in concert with the Byzantine consensus mechanism: while BFT handles overt faults (crash, wrong responses), GFSS detects subtle coordinated attacks that individual fault checks would miss.", "metadata": {"source": "scbe_aethermoore", "version": "3.3.0", "author": "Issac Davis", "origin": "hydra_architecture"}}

AV-VISION (Avali, 60deg): Screenshot agent. Captures visual state of pages. AV's cross-paradigm bridge function maps to translating visual content into structured data.\n\n3. RU-READER (Runethic, 120deg): Extraction agent. Reads and extracts text/data from pages. RU's temporal anchoring function maps to preserving extracted content accurately.\n\n4. CA-CLICKER (Cassisivadan, 180deg): Interaction agent. Clicks buttons, follows links, interacts with UI elements. CA's playful recursive function maps to exploring interactive elements.\n\n5. UM-TYPER (Umbroth, 240deg): Input agent. Types text, fills forms, enters data. UM's concealment function maps to handling sensitive input securely.\n\n6. DR-JUDGE (Draumric, 300deg): Verification agent. Validates results, confirms actions succeeded, judges output quality.

Heads (Universal AI Interface): The abstraction layer that allows any AI system to 'wear' HYDRA as armor. Provides standardized interfaces for Claude, Codex, GPT, local LLMs, and other AI systems. Each head adapts the AI's native capabilities to HYDRA's coordination protocol.\n\n3. Limbs (Execution Backends): The actual execution infrastructure. Manages browser instances, terminal sessions, file system operations, and API calls. Limbs are the physical manifestation of agent actions in the real environment.\n\n4. Librarian (Memory & Knowledge): Cross-session memory with semantic search and knowledge graph capabilities. Stores conversation history, extracted data, learned patterns, and inter-session context.

The multiplier accounts for:\n\n1. Tongue permutations: 6! = 720 possible orderings\n2. Phase combinations: Each tongue at a unique 60-degree phase offset\n3. Weight interactions: Golden ratio weights (1.0, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236, 6.854, 11.090) creating non-uniform security distribution\n4. BFT quorum: 4/6 minimum agreement requirement\n\nThe 518,400x multiplier means an attacker must compromise not just one authentication layer but the entire multi-tongue, multi-phase, multi-weight security stack simultaneously.
