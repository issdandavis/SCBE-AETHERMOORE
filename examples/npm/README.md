# NPM Starter Assets (AI Fleet)

These assets are shipped in the npm package so users can start quickly with practical fleet patterns.

## Included

- `agents/` — pre-made agent role templates
- `use-cases/` — scenario JSON examples

## How to use

1. Copy a template from `agents/`.
2. Adapt IDs, risk levels, and allowed actions for your environment.
3. Use a scenario from `use-cases/` as a starter payload for orchestration demos.

> These are starter templates. Treat them as non-production defaults and harden policies before deployment.
