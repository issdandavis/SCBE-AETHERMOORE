- [x] Policy enforcement (block/approve based on risk)
- [x] Constitutional AI checks (Anthropic-style)
- [x] Output validation for dangerous commands
- [x] Audit logging with timestamps

### API Endpoints

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (Non-blocking)

### Python Test Failures (6 tests)
1. `test_phase_transform_distance_preservation` - Math precision edge case
2-6. `TestSecurityAgentTasks` + `TestFullOrchestrationPipeline` - Mock/async infrastructure issues in test harness (not production code)

### Missing Optional Dependencies
Some tests require optional packages not installed in CI:
- `hypothesis` - Property-based testing
- `httpx` - HTTP client for API tests
- `pycryptodome` - Alternative crypto library

These can be installed with:
```bash
pip install hypothesis httpx pycryptodome
```

### TypeScript Build Warnings
Non-blocking type warnings in:
- `src/harmonic/spiralSeal.ts` - BufferSource type compatibility
- `src/network/contact-graph.ts` - Missing uuid types

---

## 📋 OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Short-term
- [ ] Install `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- [ ] Add uuid types to package.json
- [ ] Fix BufferSource type casting in spiralSeal.ts

### Medium-term
- [ ] Add NIST PQC compliance tests (requires `liboqs`)
- [ ] Add Byzantine consensus network simulation
- [ ] Increase test coverage for `ai_orchestration/` modules

### Long-term
- [ ] Hardware security module (HSM) integration
- [ ] Side-channel resistance validation on hardware
- [ ] SOC 2 Type II audit preparation

## 📊 Test Summary

```
TypeScript: 950/950 passed (100%)
Python Core: 97/103 passed (94.2%)
Fleet Manager: 20/20 passed (100%)
AI Safety: 13/13 passed (100%)
```

## Conclusion

The SCBE-AETHERMOORE system is **operational and suitable for pilot or proof-of-concept use** with core components verified and deployed. It should not be described as regulated-enterprise-ready or bank-ready without the compliance, support, and hardening work listed above.
