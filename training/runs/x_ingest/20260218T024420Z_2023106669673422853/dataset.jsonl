Overview of AetherAuth - behavioral proof of system AetherAuth is a component of the SCBE-AETHERMOORE framework (Issac Davis, patent pending #63/961,403), designed as a \"behavioral proof system\" replacing static OAuth tokens with context-bound cryptographic envelopes. The system embeds 6D context vectors (time, IP, CPU/memory, intent, history) into a Poincar\u00e9 ball to compute trust rings (CORE r<0.3, OUTER r>0.7, WALL), decrypts vaulted keys only when geometric conditions are met, and produces indistinguishable garbage on mismatch (\"Fail", "generated_at": "2026-02-18T02:44:34.756012+00:00"}

It extends this with a Calabi-Yau mirror duality for automatic key rotation triggered by environmental flux.\u200b\u200b This report examines each of these mechanisms through the lens of open-access academic literature, identifying which ideas are well-supported, which are novel, and where critical gaps remain. 2. Poincar\u00e9 Ball Embeddings for Trust Scoring Established Literature The use of the Poincar\u00e9 ball model of hyperbolic space for hierarchical and relational embeddings is well-established in machine learning. Nickel & Kiela (2017) introduced Poincar\u00e9 embeddings for learning hierarchical representations, and subsequent work has expanded this significantly: Bala\u017eevi\u0107 et al. (2019), \"Multi-relational Poincar\u00e9 Graph Embeddings,\" demonstrated that the Poincar\u00e9 ball can capture multiple simultaneous hierarchies in knowledge graphs, a property directly relevant to AetherAuth's tiered trust rings.\u200b Shimizu et al.

The hierarchical nature of access tiers maps naturally to hyperbolic geometry, where distance from the origin grows exponentially near the boundary\u2014aligning with the design's intent to make outer-ring operations exponentially more expensive. Critical Gap However, the prior workspace audit found that AetherAuth's hyperbolic embedding may not provide meaningful security beyond a simple Euclidean distance check. Claude Code audit sessions revealed that a baseline 2-layer Euclidean pipeline achieved AUC 0.984 on subtle attacks, while the full 14-layer pipeline scored only AUC 0.054\u2014worse than random. The hyperbolic transformation appears to be a monotone transform of the Euclidean norm, adding zero information in the tested configuration. This is a critical discrepancy between theoretical elegance and empirical utility.\u200b 3. Fail-to-Noise and Honey Encryption Established Literature AetherAuth's \"Fail-to-Noise\" mechanism\u2014where incorrect decryption attempts yield indistinguishable random output rather than error messages\u2014is conceptually related to Honey Encryption (HE), introduced by Juels and Ristenpart (2014): Juels & Ristenpart (2014) de", "generated_at": "2026-02-18T02:44:34.756264+00:00"}

A comprehensive review from Queen's University Belfast summarizes: \"HE generates a ciphertext which, when decrypted with an invalid key, yields a plausible-looking but invalid plaintext referred to as a honey message\".\u200b Honey Encryption for NLP (arXiv:2010.15985, 2020) extended the concept using differential privacy to generate contextually similar decoy messages, noting that \"a gibberish, random assortment of words is not enough to fool an attacker\".\u200b Honeyword security metrics (arXiv:2311.10960, 2023) provided theoretical formulas for flatness and success-number functions in honey techniques.\u200b Bernoulli Honeywords (arXiv:2212.12759, 2022) proposed symmetric honeyword designs with quantifiable false breach-detection probability.\u200b A 2025 USENIX paper on \"Practically Secure Honey Password Vaults\" presents new designs that \"generate plausible decoy vaults for incorrect master passwords\".\u200b Relevance to AetherAuth AetherAuth's Fail-to-Noise differs from classical honey encryption in an important way: rather than produ", "generated_at": "2026-02-18T02:44:34.756305+00:00"}

This is a simpler approach that prevents oracle attacks (the attacker cannot distinguish failure from success) but does not achieve the full HE property of producing semantically plausible decoys. The user's query correctly identifies this as \"indistinguishable garbage\" rather than honey messages. The AES-GCM construction with context-salted key derivation is sound cryptographic engineering. The use of Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) binding to user identity is standard practice. However, the workspace vulnerability assessment (Page 24 of the Notion workspace) flagged that there is no formal security reduction proving that breaking this context-bound encryption is at least as hard as some well-known hard problem.\u200b 4. Context-Aware Zero-Trust Authentication Established Literature AetherAuth's approach of using multi-dimensional context vectors for continuous authentication aligns with a growing body of zero-trust research: ZTMAF (arXiv:2506.05355, 2025) presents a \"Zero-Trust Mobility-Aware Authentication Framework\" that integrates \"context", "generated_at": "2026-02-18T02:44:34.756408+00:00"}

Zero-Trust Identity Framework for Agentic AI (arXiv:2505.19301, 2025) proposes a framework using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) with Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving attribute disclosure. Critically, it addresses the same problem space as AetherAuth\u2014securing AI agent interactions\u2014with dynamic fine-grained access control and real-time policy enforcement. Zero-Trust Foundation Models (arXiv:2505.23792, 2025) embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation models, with four core principles: Least Privilege Access, Continuous Verification, Data Confidentiality and Integrity, and Behavioral Analytics.\u200b A systematic literature review on ZTA (PMC:12526847, 2025) documents that \"Yang Tao et al. designed a fine-grained data access control model with user context recognition based on Zero Trust principles\" performing \"multi-stage authentication u", "generated_at": "2026-02-18T02:44:34.756453+00:00"}

Post-Quantum Lattice-Based Cryptography (Kyber/ML-KEM) Established Literature AetherAuth references Kyber768 and ML-DSA as its post-quantum cryptographic primitives, consistent with NIST's 2024 standardization: NIST FIPS 203 (August 2024) standardized ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism) based on CRYSTALS-Kyber.

Critical Gap in AetherAuth The prior workspace audit identified that AetherAuth's Kyber/Dilithium integration is simulated with os.urandom(), not real post-quantum cryptography. The Implementation Proof Package (Page 26 of the workspace) explicitly acknowledges this. Until these simulated components are replaced with actual implementations from libraries like liboqs (Open Quantum Safe), the \"post-quantum\" designation is aspirational rather than functional.\u200b 6. Calabi-Yau Manifold Mirror Duality for Key Rotation Established Literature The Calabi-Yau mirror duality extension is the most exotic component of AetherAuth. Academic work connecting Calabi-Yau geometry to cryptography is extremely limited but does exist: Z-Sigil (arXiv:2601.10883, January 2026) by Andrea Rondelli introduces a public-key cryptographic algorithm operating \"over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold, where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers.\" This is the closest published work to AetherAuth's mirror duality concept, using continuous geometric structures for quantum-resistant key spaces.

In string theory, Calabi-Yau mirror symmetry exchanges Hodge numbers h1,1\u2194h2,1h1,1\u2194h2,1, preserving topological invariants like the Euler characteristic. This is the mathematical foundation AetherAuth claims to use for key rotation. Assessment AetherAuth's mirror duality for key rotation\u2014where keys on one Calabi-Yau manifold swap to a mirror manifold on flux events\u2014is creative but highly speculative. The Z-Sigil paper shows that Calabi-Yau-based cryptography is being explored academically, but:\u200b Z-Sigil uses the tangent fiber bundle structure, not mirror symmetry for key rotation. No published work demonstrates that mirror duality provides security advantages for key management. The user's query mentions verification via Euler characteristic invariance \u03c7(X)=\u03c7(Y)\u03c7(X)=\u03c7(Y), which is mathematically correct for Calabi-Yau mirror pairs but has not been validated as a cryptographic equivalence check. The hysteresis mechanism (swap only if flux > 0.5 for 3 cycles) is a practical engineering safeguard against oscillation, but there is no formal analysis of its security properties. 7.

This self-assessment is consistent with established cryptographic principles\u2014security through obscurity (including constructed languages) provides no formal guarantees.
