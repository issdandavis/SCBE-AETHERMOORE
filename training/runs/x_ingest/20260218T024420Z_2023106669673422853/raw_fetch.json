Overview of AetherAuth - behavioral proof of system\nAetherAuth is a component of the SCBE-AETHERMOORE framework (Issac Davis, patent pending #63/961,403), designed as a \"behavioral proof system\" replacing static OAuth tokens with context-bound cryptographic envelopes. The system embeds 6D context vectors (time, IP, CPU/memory, intent, history) into a Poincar\u00e9 ball to compute trust rings (CORE r<0.3, OUTER r>0.7, WALL), decrypts vaulted keys only when geometric conditions are met, and produces indistinguishable garbage on mismatch (\"Fail-to-Noise\"). It extends this with a Calabi-Yau mirror duality for automatic key rotation triggered by environmental flux.\u200b\u200b\nThis report examines each of these mechanisms through the lens of open-access academic literature, identifying which ideas are well-supported, which are novel, and where critical gaps remain.\n2. Poincar\u00e9 Ball Embeddings for Trust Scoring\nEstablished Literature\nThe use of the Poincar\u00e9 ball model of hyperbolic space for hierarchical and relational embeddings is well-established in machine learning. Nickel & Kiela (2017) introduced Poincar\u00e9 embeddings for learning hierarchical representations, and subsequent work has expanded this significantly:\nBala\u017eevi\u0107 et al. (2019), \"Multi-relational Poincar\u00e9 Graph Embeddings,\" demonstrated that the Poincar\u00e9 ball can capture multiple simultaneous hierarchies in knowledge graphs, a property directly relevant to AetherAuth's tiered trust rings.\u200b\nShimizu et al. (2021), \"Highly Scalable and Provably Accurate Classification in Poincare Balls,\" established a unified framework for hyperbolic linear classifiers with provably accurate convex optimization.\u200b\nVan De Ven et al. (2023), \"Poincar\u00e9 ResNet,\" introduced end-to-end residual networks operating entirely in hyperbolic space, showing that visual representations can be learned directly in the Poincar\u00e9 ball.\u200b\nCao et al. (2025), referenced in a 2025 survey on hyperbolic RAG, demonstrated Poincar\u00e9 ball projections for encoding hierarchical depth.\u200b\nA comprehensive 2025 survey on hyperbolic graph embeddings specifically evaluates these models for anomaly detection, demonstrating that \"hyperbolic distances\" provide enhanced anomaly separability compared to Euclidean baselines.\nHADNet (2025) at PubMed Central directly applies hyperbolic space transformations for industrial anomaly detection, mapping features from Euclidean to hyperbolic space and showing that the hyperbolic distance metric represents feature distances \"more effectively\".\u200b\nJANUS (2025) explicitly combines Euclidean and hyperbolic representations for node-level anomaly detection, finding that dual-geometry approaches outperform single-geometry baselines.\u200b\nRelevance to AetherAuth\nAetherAuth's use of the Poincar\u00e9 ball for trust ring classification (CORE/INNER/OUTER/WALL) has solid theoretical grounding. The hierarchical nature of access tiers maps naturally to hyperbolic geometry, where distance from the origin grows exponentially near the boundary\u2014aligning with the design's intent to make outer-ring operations exponentially more expensive.\nCritical Gap\nHowever, the prior workspace audit found that AetherAuth's hyperbolic embedding may not provide meaningful security beyond a simple Euclidean distance check. Claude Code audit sessions revealed that a baseline 2-layer Euclidean pipeline achieved AUC 0.984 on subtle attacks, while the full 14-layer pipeline scored only AUC 0.054\u2014worse than random. The hyperbolic transformation appears to be a monotone transform of the Euclidean norm, adding zero information in the tested configuration. This is a critical discrepancy between theoretical elegance and empirical utility.\u200b\n3. Fail-to-Noise and Honey Encryption\nEstablished Literature\nAetherAuth's \"Fail-to-Noise\" mechanism\u2014where incorrect decryption attempts yield indistinguishable random output rather than error messages\u2014is conceptually related to Honey Encryption (HE), introduced by Juels and Ristenpart (2014):\nJuels & Ristenpart (2014) defined honey encryption as producing \"ciphertexts that decrypt under incorrect keys to seemingly valid (decoy) messages\".\nA comprehensive review from "
