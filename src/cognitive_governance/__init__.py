# SCBE-AETHERMOORE Cognitive Governance
# Geometric AI Alignment through Hypercube Constraint
#
# Core insight: Governance through topology, not rules.
# Certain actions become geometrically impossible in the
# hyperdimensional space where AI cognition exists.
#
# Key geometry: Double Hypercubes
# - Standard hypercube (tesseract) from 4D
# - "Double" from exponential^exponential structure (R^(d²))
# - Phase shifting creates asymmetric projections
# - Negative/neutral/positive space = 3 directional states
