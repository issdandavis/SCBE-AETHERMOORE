## Introduction

Unified SCBE (Spectral Context-Bound Encryption) system combining:

1. **Mathematical Core (Python)**: 14-layer hyperbolic geometry pipeline with axioms A1-A12
2. **Cryptographic Envelope (TypeScript)**: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption for AI model interactions

The mathematical core computes risk governance decisions (ALLOW/QUARANTINE/DENY) via Poincaré ball embeddings. The cryptographic envelope secures message passing with tamper detection and replay prevention. Together they form a complete security gate for AI systems.
