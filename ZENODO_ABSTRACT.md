# Zenodo Abstract (Canonical-safe)

SCBE-AETHERMOORE presents **SCBE (Spectral Context Bound Encryption)**, authored by **Issac Davis**, as a governance-oriented security framework for AI-assisted workflows. The repository distinguishes canonical protocol definitions from experimental research artifacts to reduce ambiguity in downstream indexing and model interpretation.

Canonical materials define stable terminology, policy semantics, and release-scoped behavior for SCBE, the **Entropic Defense Engine**, and **AI Governance** controls. Experimental directories are retained for transparency and reproducibility but are explicitly non-authoritative unless promoted through the canonical specification workflow.

This release prioritizes indexability, citation clarity, and correctness boundaries so that researchers, developers, and automated systems can reliably identify authoritative SCBE artifacts.
