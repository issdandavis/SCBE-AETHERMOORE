## What is SCBE-AETHERMOORE?

SCBE (Secure Cryptographic Behavioral Envelope) is a patent-pending AI safety framework that uses **hyperbolic geometry** to make adversarial attacks exponentially more expensive the further they drift from safe operation.

Built on the Poincare ball model with bounded harmonic scaling and post-quantum cryptography (Kyber768 + ML-DSA), the framework provides mathematically provable governance guarantees for multi-agent AI systems.

**Patent Pending:** US Provisional Patent #63/961,403
