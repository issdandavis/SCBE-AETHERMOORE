## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive prior art analysis across seven technology domains relevant to the SCBE-AETHERMOORE Continuation-in-Part (CIP) patent filing. The analysis covers patents, published patent applications, academic papers, open standards, and commercial products that may constitute prior art against our claims.

### Key Findings

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE's primary differentiator is the unified integration of all seven domains into a single coherent 14-layer architecture.** While individual prior art exists in each domain, no single reference or obvious combination of references teaches or suggests the specific synthesis that SCBE-AETHERMOORE achieves. Specifically:

- **No prior art combines hyperbolic geometry safety scoring with post-quantum cryptographic AI identity** within a layered governance framework
- **No prior art teaches constructed language protocols (Sacred Tongues) as a security and governance mechanism** for AI fleet communication
- **No prior art describes the specific H(d,pd) = 1/(1+d+2*pd) bounded safety score function** tied to Poincare Half-Disk Model geometry for AI governance decisions
- **The "Context Energy" economic model** with per-operation energy accounting tied to safety layer depth is novel
- **Byzantine fault tolerance applied through concentric ring topology** with Sacred Tongue encoding is not found in any prior art

### Overall Risk Assessment

| Domain | Highest Risk Level | Key Concern |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| AI Governance Frameworks | MEDIUM | Layered architectures exist but with different structure/purpose |
| Hyperbolic Geometry in ML | LOW | Academic work exists but not applied to AI safety scoring |
| Post-Quantum Crypto for AI | MEDIUM | Emerging field; Gopher Security blog posts describe similar concepts |
| Multi-AI Fleet Governance | MEDIUM | BFT for AI safety is an active research area |
| Cultural Intelligence / Commonsense | LOW | Existing KGs serve different purpose than SCBE tongues |
| Constructed Languages for AI | LOW | No prior art on constructed languages as security mechanism |
| Context Credit / AI Economics | LOW-MEDIUM | Tokenized compute exists but different from Context Energy |

## 2. AI Governance Frameworks

### 2.1 C3.AI Enterprise Generative AI Architecture

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | US Patent 12,111,859 B2 |
| **Title** | Enterprise Generative Artificial Intelligence Architecture |
| **Date** | Granted 2024 |
| **Assignee** | C3.ai, Inc. |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Describes a layered enterprise AI architecture with six layers: input layer, supervisory layer, agent layer, agent and tool layer, tool and data model layer, and external layer. The supervisory layer uses LLMs to develop plans for responding to inputs. Agents execute prescribed tasks with full traceability to sources, enterprise access controls, and LLM-agnostic design.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- C3.AI's 6 layers are functionally different from SCBE's 14 layers (L1-L14), which encode a specific safety/governance hierarchy from Symphonic Cipher (L1) through Concentric Ring Policy (L14)
- C3.AI lacks hyperbolic geometry-based safety scoring
- C3.AI lacks post-quantum cryptographic identity for agents
- C3.AI lacks constructed language (Sacred Tongues) communication protocol
- C3.AI's supervisory layer is LLM-based plan generation; SCBE's layers encode mathematical safety invariants (H(d,pd) function)
- C3.AI focuses on enterprise task orchestration; SCBE focuses on AI safety governance with mathematical guarantees

### 2.3 NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | NIST AI 100-1 |
| **Title** | Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework |
| **Date** | January 26, 2023 |
| **Publisher** | U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Voluntary framework for organizations to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into AI design, development, use, and evaluation. Provides four core functions: GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE. Extended by NIST AI 600-1 (Generative AI Profile) in July 2024.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- NIST AI RMF is a policy/process framework, not a technical architecture with executable code
- Does not define mathematical safety functions or cryptographic identity
- Does not specify implementation architecture with numbered layers
- SCBE-AETHERMOORE implements a technical system that could be used to satisfy NIST AI RMF requirements, but the framework itself is organizational guidance, not a patentable system

### 2.4 EU AI Act Governance Framework

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 |
| **Title** | The AI Act |
| **Date** | 2024 |
| **Publisher** | European Union |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** First comprehensive legal framework on AI worldwide. Establishes risk-based categorization (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal risk) with corresponding obligations. Prohibits certain AI practices including emotion recognition in workplaces and education (effective February 2025).

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- EU AI Act is legislation, not a technical architecture
- SCBE-AETHERMOORE could serve as a technical implementation framework to achieve EU AI Act compliance
- The Act does not teach any specific technical implementation for safety scoring, cryptographic identity, or multi-agent governance

**Source:** [EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)

### 2.5 Five-Layer AI Governance Framework (Academic)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2509.11332 |
| **Title** | A Five-Layer Framework for AI Governance: Integrating Regulation, Standards, and Certification |
| **Date** | September 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Proposes a five-layer governance framework spanning regulatory mandates, standards, assessment methodologies, and certification processes.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Academic governance layers (regulation, standards, assessment, certification) are organizational/policy layers, not technical architecture layers
- SCBE's 14 layers are executable software layers with mathematical safety invariants
- No overlap in the nature of "layers" between this framework and SCBE

**Source:** [arXiv:2509.11332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11332)

### 2.6 Towards Guaranteed Safe AI (Dalrymple et al., 2024)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2405.06624 |
| **Title** | Towards Guaranteed Safe AI: A Framework for Ensuring Robust and Reliable AI Systems |
| **Date** | May 10, 2024 |
| **Authors** | David Dalrymple, Joar Skalse, Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Max Tegmark, et al. |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Introduces "Guaranteed Safe (GS) AI" — systems equipped with high-assurance quantitative safety guarantees through three core components: (1) a world model providing mathematical description of AI effects on the outside world, (2) a safety specification describing acceptable effects, and (3) a verifier providing auditable proof certificates that the AI satisfies safety specifications relative to the world model.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- GS AI is a theoretical framework; SCBE-AETHERMOORE is a working implementation (50K+ LOC, 2620 passing tests)
- GS AI uses formal verification (proof certificates); SCBE uses bounded harmonic safety scoring H(d,pd) with real-time evaluation
- SCBE adds post-quantum cryptographic identity, Sacred Tongue encoding, and Context Energy economics — none of which appear in the GS AI framework
- SCBE's 14-layer architecture is a specific structural claim not taught by GS AI's three-component model
- **Note:** This paper shares the general goal of mathematically grounded AI safety, making it important to distinguish our specific mathematical approach (Poincare Half-Disk harmonic functions) from their formal verification approach

### 2.7 Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) Framework

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2508.18765 |
| **Title** | Governance-as-a-Service: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI System Compliance and Policy Enforcement |
| **Date** | August 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Proposes a modular, policy-driven enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without modifying internal model logic or assuming agent cooperation. Uses declarative rules (JSON-encoded) and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and severity-weighted violations. Operates as a non-invasive runtime proxy.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- GaaS uses simple severity-weighted compliance scoring; SCBE uses H(d,pd) = 1/(1+d+2*pd) bounded safety score derived from hyperbolic geometry
- GaaS is a single enforcement layer; SCBE has 14 distinct layers with different functions
- GaaS lacks cryptographic identity, constructed language protocols, and Context Energy economics
- GaaS is JSON-rule-based; SCBE integrates mathematical safety invariants from Poincare geometry
- **Note:** GaaS's Trust Factor mechanism and runtime proxy approach have conceptual overlap with SCBE's safety evaluation. CIP claims should clearly distinguish the mathematical basis

### 2.8 Anthropic Constitutional AI

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2212.08073 |
| **Title** | Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback |
| **Date** | December 2022 |
| **Authors** | Anthropic Research |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Trains harmless AI assistants through self-improvement using a "constitution" (set of principles) without human labels for harmful outputs. Combines RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) with principle-based self-critique and revision.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Constitutional AI is a training-time method (modifying model weights); SCBE is a runtime governance architecture
- Constitutional AI uses natural language principles; SCBE uses mathematical safety functions and constructed language protocols
- Constitutional AI does not address multi-agent fleet governance, cryptographic identity, or compute economics
- No layered architecture in Constitutional AI — it is a single training procedure
- No patent application found for Constitutional AI specifically; published as open research

### 2.9 OpenAI Content Classification Patent

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | US20240362421A1 |
| **Title** | Content Classification (AI Safety) |
| **Date** | Filed ~2023, Published 2024 |
| **Assignee** | OpenAI |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Patent application for content classification systems designed to identify and filter undesired materials. Connected to OpenAI's Superalignment initiative. Filed with accelerated examination but faced delays due to numerous prior art references.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- OpenAI's patent addresses content classification (filtering specific content types); SCBE addresses holistic AI governance across 14 architectural layers
- No mathematical safety scoring function in OpenAI's approach
- No multi-agent governance, cryptographic identity, or constructed language protocols
- Different problem domain: content filtering vs. comprehensive AI safety architecture

## 3. Hyperbolic Geometry in Machine Learning

### 3.1 Poincare Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:1705.08039 / NeurIPS 2017 |
| **Title** | Poincare Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations |
| **Date** | May 22, 2017 |
| **Authors** | Maximilian Nickel, Douwe Kiela (Facebook AI Research) |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Seminal work introducing learning hierarchical representations by embedding symbolic data into an n-dimensional Poincare ball. Demonstrates that hyperbolic space naturally captures hierarchy and similarity simultaneously. Uses Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent (RSGD) for optimization. Evaluated on taxonomy embedding, link prediction, and lexical entailment. Open-sourced as PyTorch implementation.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Nickel & Kiela use Poincare ball for data representation learning (embeddings); SCBE uses Poincare Half-Disk Model for computing AI safety scores
- Nickel & Kiela's application: hierarchical data embedding and retrieval. SCBE's application: real-time safety decision-making for AI governance
- SCBE's H(d,pd) = 1/(1+d+2*pd) is a bounded harmonic safety function on the Poincare Half-Disk, not an embedding function on the Poincare ball — different mathematical object and different geometric model
- SCBE combines the hyperbolic safety score with 13 other architectural layers including PQC identity — this integration is not suggested by Nickel & Kiela
- **No patent application found** for this work; published as open research with open-source code
- **Important:** This is the closest mathematical prior art. CIP claims must clearly specify the Poincare Half-Disk Model (not ball), the specific H(d,pd) function form, and the application to AI governance safety scoring

### 3.2 Hyperbolic Neural Networks++

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | OpenReview (ICLR submission) |
| **Title** | Hyperbolic Neural Networks++ |
| **Date** | 2021 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Generalizes fundamental neural network components (multinomial logistic regression, fully-connected layers, convolutional layers, attention mechanisms) within the Poincare ball model under a unified mathematical interpretation.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- HNN++ builds neural network layers in hyperbolic space for general ML tasks; SCBE uses hyperbolic geometry specifically for safety scoring functions
- Different application domain (general ML vs. AI governance)
- SCBE does not build neural network layers in hyperbolic space; it computes a single bounded safety score using a harmonic function

### 3.3 Hyperbolic Image-Text Representations (MERU)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2304.09172 / ICML 2023 |
| **Title** | Hyperbolic Image-Text Representations |
| **Date** | April 2023 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Applies hyperbolic embeddings to multimodal (image-text) representation learning, leveraging the natural hierarchy in visual-linguistic concepts.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Multimodal representation learning has no connection to AI safety governance
- Different mathematical application of hyperbolic geometry
- No safety scoring, no governance layers, no cryptographic identity

**Source:** [arXiv:2304.09172](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09172)

---

### 3.4 Summary: Hyperbolic Geometry + AI Safety Gap

**Critical finding:** No prior art was found that combines hyperbolic geometry (Poincare ball or half-disk) with AI safety scoring or AI governance. The application of Poincare Half-Disk harmonic functions to compute bounded AI safety scores is novel. All existing hyperbolic geometry ML work focuses on representation learning (embeddings) for data, not safety/governance decision-making.

## 4. Post-Quantum Cryptography for AI Systems

### 4.1 NIST PQC Standards (FIPS 203, 204, 205)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) |
| **Title** | Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards |
| **Date** | August 14, 2024 (effective) |
| **Publisher** | NIST |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** (standards, not prior art for our claims) |

**Summary:** NIST finalized three post-quantum encryption standards: ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism, formerly CRYSTALS-Kyber), ML-DSA (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium), and SLH-DSA (Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard). These are the underlying cryptographic primitives that SCBE-AETHERMOORE uses.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- NIST provides the cryptographic primitives; SCBE-AETHERMOORE provides the application of those primitives to AI agent identity, governance, and fleet management
- SCBE's novel contribution is the integration pattern: PQC identity bound to a 14-layer safety governance architecture with Sacred Tongue encoding
- Using standardized PQC algorithms (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65) is expected and appropriate; the novelty is in how they are applied to AI governance

### 4.2 Lattice-Based Zero Trust Identity for AI Agents (Gopher Security)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | Blog series (multiple posts) |
| **Title** | Lattice-Based Zero Trust Identity Verification for AI Agents; Post-Quantum Identity and Access Management for AI Agents; Quantum-Resistant IAM for Federated AI Agents |
| **Date** | Late 2025 / January 2026 |
| **Publisher** | Gopher Security |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

**Summary:** A series of blog posts describing the use of ML-KEM and ML-DSA for quantum-resistant AI agent identity verification within zero-trust frameworks. Discusses preventing puppet attacks and tool poisoning in Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployments. Covers lattice-based identity for MCP hosts and federated AI agent scenarios. Discusses "Harvest Now Decrypt Later" threats to long-term agent credentials.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Gopher Security describes PQC for AI agent identity in isolation; SCBE integrates PQC identity within a 14-layer governance architecture that also includes hyperbolic safety scoring and Sacred Tongue encoding
- Gopher Security's posts are conceptual/advisory (blog posts, not implementations or patents); SCBE has working code (50K+ LOC)
- SCBE's PQC identity layer binds to specific governance decisions through the H(d,pd) safety function — this integration is not described by Gopher Security
- **Concern:** These posts describe very similar concepts to SCBE's PQC identity layer. The CIP filing should emphasize the integration with other layers rather than PQC identity in isolation
- **Note:** Blog posts published after our priority date (Jan 15, 2026) may not constitute prior art, but earlier posts in the series should be reviewed for exact publication dates

**Summary:** Proposes a digital identity solution combining generative AI, blockchain, and post-quantum cryptographic techniques. Uses lattice-based cryptography as backbone security. Addresses quantum computing threats to existing identity systems.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- This work focuses on human digital identity with AI assistance; SCBE focuses on AI agent identity within a governance architecture
- No hyperbolic safety scoring, no Sacred Tongue encoding, no 14-layer architecture
- Different target: human identity preservation vs. AI fleet governance
- SCBE does not use blockchain for identity (uses direct PQC signatures in the governance layer)

## 5. Multi-AI Fleet Governance

### 5.1 Byzantine Fault Tolerance Approach to AI Safety (deVadoss, 2025)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2504.14668 |
| **Title** | A Byzantine Fault Tolerance Approach towards AI Safety |
| **Date** | April 2025 |
| **Authors** | John deVadoss |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

**Summary:** Draws explicit analogy between unreliable/malicious AI artifacts and Byzantine nodes in distributed systems. Proposes structuring AI systems as ensembles of AI modules that check and balance each other through consensus mechanisms. Key principles: module isolation (failure in one does not corrupt others), interaction only through consensus mechanism, design diversity (different architectures/training data for redundancy), and strong assurances that no single errant component can steer the system into an unsafe state.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- deVadoss proposes BFT as a general architectural principle for AI safety; SCBE implements a specific 14-layer governance architecture that includes BFT at the COORDINATE layer (L12) as one component
- deVadoss does not describe hyperbolic safety scoring, PQC identity, Sacred Tongue encoding, or Context Energy economics
- SCBE's Concentric Ring Policy (L14) is a specific topology for BFT governance, not a generic ensemble approach
- SCBE's BFT implementation uses Sacred Tongue-encoded messages for Byzantine-resistant communication — a unique combination not taught by deVadoss
- **Concern:** The general concept of BFT for AI safety is clearly articulated in this paper, published before our CIP filing deadline. CIP claims involving BFT should be narrowed to our specific implementation (Concentric Ring + Sacred Tongues + H(d,pd) scoring)

### 5.2 CP-WBFT: Confidence Probe-Based Weighted BFT for Multi-Agent Systems

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2511.10400 |
| **Title** | Rethinking the Reliability of Multi-agent System: A Perspective from Byzantine Fault Tolerance |
| **Date** | November 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Designs CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism for LLM-based multi-agent systems. Capitalizes on intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs. Achieves superior performance under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7% fault rate) across diverse network topologies.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- CP-WBFT uses LLM confidence probes as the weighting mechanism; SCBE uses H(d,pd) harmonic safety scores derived from Poincare geometry
- CP-WBFT operates at the LLM output level; SCBE operates at the architectural governance level across 14 layers
- SCBE includes PQC identity and Sacred Tongue encoding for Byzantine-resistant communication — CP-WBFT does not
- **Note:** Published after our priority date (Nov 2025 vs. Jan 15, 2026 priority), so timing relationship depends on exact dates

| **Risk Level** | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Cross-platform specification for enabling AI agents to communicate, collaborate, and delegate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Focuses on interoperability and task delegation.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- A2A is a communication protocol for task delegation; SCBE is a safety governance architecture
- A2A does not include safety scoring, PQC identity, or constructed language encoding
- A2A focuses on interoperability; SCBE focuses on safety-governed collaboration with mathematical guarantees
- A2A could be used as a transport layer under SCBE's governance architecture

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | Google Research (2025/2026) |
| **Title** | Scaling Principles for Multi-Agent Coordination |
| **Date** | December 2025 / February 2026 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Google Research evaluated 180 agent configurations to derive scaling principles. Found centralized multi-agent systems (single coordinator directing sub-agents) performed 80% better than single agents for financial-analysis tasks. Google also dominates AI patent applications overall.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Google's work focuses on performance optimization of multi-agent configurations; SCBE focuses on safety governance
- Google's centralized coordinator pattern is different from SCBE's Concentric Ring topology with decentralized BFT
- No safety scoring, PQC identity, or Sacred Tongue protocols in Google's coordination research

### 5.5 Decentralized Governance of AI Agents

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:2412.17114 |
| **Title** | Decentralized Governance of AI Agents |
| **Date** | December 2024 |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Proposes a decentralized committee of Trust Oracles that monitors agent actions, obtains integrity attestations from trusted execution environments, and executes a Proof-of-Behavior consensus protocol to reconcile a global trust state.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Uses "Trust Oracles" and "Proof-of-Behavior" — different mechanism from SCBE's H(d,pd) safety scoring with Concentric Ring Policy
- Relies on trusted execution environments; SCBE relies on PQC cryptographic identity
- Does not include constructed language encoding or hyperbolic geometry
- **Note:** "Proof-of-Behavior" concept has some conceptual similarity to SCBE's behavioral safety assessment, but the implementation mechanism is fundamentally different

## 6. Cultural Intelligence / Commonsense Knowledge for AI

### 6.1 COMET: Commonsense Transformers (Bosselut et al., 2019)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | arXiv:1906.05317 / ACL 2019 |
| **Title** | COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction |
| **Date** | June 2019 |
| **Authors** | Antoine Bosselut et al. |
| **Publisher** | Allen Institute for AI (AI2) / Microsoft Research |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Learns to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Transfers implicit knowledge from pre-trained language models to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Achieves 77.5% precision on ATOMIC and 91.7% on ConceptNet.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- COMET generates commonsense knowledge for general NLP tasks; SCBE's Sacred Tongues are constructed languages for secure AI governance communication
- COMET's knowledge is in natural language; Sacred Tongues use designed phonological/grammatical systems with cryptographic properties
- COMET does not address AI safety governance, fleet management, or cryptographic identity
- Fundamentally different purpose: knowledge graph construction vs. secure governance communication

| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** New commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) containing general-purpose commonsense knowledge not readily available in pretrained language models. Covers social, physical, and eventive commonsense dimensions.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- ATOMIC 2020 is a knowledge graph for commonsense reasoning; SCBE's cultural intelligence operates through Sacred Tongues with platform-specific mappings
- No AI governance application in ATOMIC 2020
- SCBE's approach to cultural intelligence is unique: encoding governance decisions in constructed languages mapped to specific platforms (Twitter->KO, LinkedIn->AV, etc.)

### 6.3 Emotion AI Patent Landscape

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | Multiple patent applications (aggregate analysis) |
| **Title** | Emotion Recognition AI Patents |
| **Date** | 2020-2025 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Patent applications in emotion recognition AI provide insight into how inventors imagine uses of their technologies. The EU AI Act (effective February 2025) prohibits emotion recognition AI in workplaces and education institutions except for medical/safety reasons. USPTO evaluates these patents based on utility, nonobviousness, and novelty.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Emotion recognition AI attempts to detect human emotions from facial/vocal cues; SCBE does not perform emotion recognition
- SCBE's "cultural intelligence" refers to constructed language protocols for cross-platform AI governance, not emotional analysis
- No overlap in technical approach or application domain

| **Reference** | US20220019904A1 |
| **Title** | Network of Knowledge Using a Common Communication Protocol |
| **Date** | Filed/Published ~2022 |
| **Assignee** | Artificial Solutions (now Teneo.ai) |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Describes a network of knowledge that combines different AI bots using a common communication protocol called NOK. Enables multiple AI agents/bots to interact within a unified network framework using standardized communication.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- NOK uses a machine-readable protocol for AI bot interoperability; SCBE's Sacred Tongues are linguistically complete constructed languages with phonology, grammar, and lexicons
- NOK focuses on knowledge sharing; Sacred Tongues encode governance decisions with cryptographic properties
- Sacred Tongues include GeoSeal (geographic context sealing) — no equivalent in NOK
- Sacred Tongues have platform-specific mappings (Twitter->KO tongue, LinkedIn->AV tongue, etc.) — NOK has no such mapping
- The "constructed language" aspect of SCBE is fundamentally different from a "communication protocol" — SCBE's tongues have linguistic properties designed for security, not just interoperability

| **Reference** | Open standard specification |
| **Title** | Agent Communication Protocol |
| **Date** | 2025 |
| **Publisher** | IBM and community |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Open standard for agent-to-agent communication transforming siloed agents into interoperable agentic systems. Every message is cryptographically signed ensuring non-repudiation and integrity. Aims to be the "HTTP of agent communication."

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- ACP is a transport-level protocol; SCBE's Sacred Tongues operate at the semantic/governance level
- ACP uses standard cryptographic signatures; SCBE uses PQC signatures bound to governance layer decisions
- ACP does not encode governance decisions in the message format itself; Sacred Tongues embed governance context in the language structure
- ACP could be used as a transport under Sacred Tongue messages

| **Date** | April 2022 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Domain-specific language model designed to capture text connotations in cybersecurity text and cyber threat intelligence. Enables automation for critical cybersecurity tasks.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- SecureBERT is a fine-tuned language model for understanding cybersecurity text; Sacred Tongues are constructed languages for encoding AI governance decisions
- Fundamentally different: ML model training vs. language construction
- No governance architecture, no safety scoring, no cryptographic identity

**Source:** [arXiv:2204.02685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02685)

### 7.7 ROILA (Robot Interaction Language)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | Academic project |
| **Title** | Robot Interaction Language |
| **Date** | 2010 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW** |

**Summary:** Spoken constructed language optimized for human-machine communication. Designed to be easily learnable by humans and optimized for efficient recognition by computer speech recognition algorithms.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- ROILA is for human-to-robot spoken communication; Sacred Tongues are for AI-to-AI governance communication
- ROILA optimizes for speech recognition; Sacred Tongues optimize for security and governance encoding
- ROILA is a single language; SCBE has six tongues mapped to platforms with GeoSeal wrapping
- Different era (2010 vs. 2026), different application domain

---

### 7.8 Summary: Constructed Languages for AI — Novel Territory

**Critical finding:** No prior art was found that describes constructed languages specifically designed as a security and governance mechanism for AI fleet communication. The concept of Sacred Tongues — linguistically complete constructed languages with platform-specific mappings, GeoSeal geographic context sealing, and cross-tongue blending for multi-platform governance — is genuinely novel. The closest prior art (SingularityNET AI-DSL) uses a programming language approach rather than a natural-like constructed language approach.

## 8. Context Credit / AI Compute Economics

### 8.1 Tokenized Compute (Compute Labs / Bittensor)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Reference** | Multiple commercial implementations |
| **Title** | Tokenized AI Compute Credits |
| **Date** | 2024-2025 |
| **Risk Level** | **MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Compute Labs packages tranches of GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA H200s) into tradable crypto assets. Bittensor (TAO token) incentivizes contributors providing compute, model training, and validation through subnet performance-tied token issuance. Combined DePIN market cap reached $19.2B by September 2025 (270% YoY increase).

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Tokenized compute credits are blockchain-based financial instruments for GPU access; SCBE's Context Energy is a per-operation safety-layer-depth accounting mechanism
- Context Energy is not a tradable token; it is an internal cost function tied to the 14-layer safety architecture
- SCBE's H(d,R) = R^(d^2) cost multiplier in the root symphonic_cipher encodes exponentially increasing cost for deeper governance penetration — this mathematical relationship is not present in any tokenized compute system
- Context Energy is consumed during safety evaluations, not during GPU computation
- No blockchain required for Context Energy

| **Date** | 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

**Summary:** Token economics creates frameworks where value creation, service delivery, and governance align through designed economic models. Unlike traditional SaaS pricing, tokenized AI services operate on principles that dynamically balance supply and demand.

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE Differentiation:**
- Token economics in agentic AI focuses on marketplace pricing and economic incentives; SCBE's Context Energy focuses on safety-governance cost accounting
- No safety scoring function in token economics approaches
- Context Energy is not a marketplace mechanism; it is an internal governance cost that increases with safety layer depth
- Different purpose: market economics vs. safety architecture economics

- Uses blockchain for audit trails; SCBE uses PQC-signed governance records without blockchain
- Different trust model: blockchain consensus vs. Concentric Ring Policy with BFT
- No hyperbolic safety scoring or constructed language encoding

**Source:** [arXiv:2512.20985](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.20985v1)

- Uses blockchain staking/slashing; SCBE uses Context Energy accounting within governance layers
- Different trust mechanism: economic incentives vs. mathematical safety invariants
- SCBE does not require blockchain infrastructure

## 9. Consolidated Risk Matrix

### By Risk Level

#### HIGH Risk (Close to Our Claims)
*None identified.* No single prior art reference teaches the combination of hyperbolic safety scoring + PQC identity + Sacred Tongue encoding + 14-layer governance architecture.

#### MEDIUM-HIGH Risk (Significant Overlap in Specific Areas)

| Reference | Area | Concern |

## 10. Recommendations for CIP Filing Strategy

### 10.1 Claims to Strengthen

1. **Hyperbolic Safety Scoring (Highest Novelty)**
   - Claim the specific H(d,pd) = 1/(1+d+2*pd) bounded safety score function on the Poincare Half-Disk Model
   - Claim the integration of this function into a multi-layer governance architecture
   - Explicitly distinguish from Poincare Ball embeddings (Nickel & Kiela) — different geometric model, different mathematical object, different application
   - Claim the dual function approach: H(d,R) = R^(d^2) cost multiplier AND H(d,pd) = 1/(1+d+2*pd) safety score

2. **Sacred Tongues (High Novelty)**
   - Claim constructed languages with designed phonological/grammatical systems for AI governance communication
   - Claim platform-specific tongue mappings (social media platform -> specific tongue)
   - Claim GeoSeal (geographic context sealing via constructed language encoding)
   - Claim cross-tongue blending for multi-platform governance decisions
   - Claim the six-tongue system: KO, AV, RU, CA, DR, UM with distinct linguistic properties

3. **Integrated 14-Layer Architecture (High Novelty)**
   - Claim the specific combination: Symphonic Cipher (L1) through Concentric Ring Policy (L14)
   - Emphasize that no prior art teaches this specific layered structure
   - Claim the interaction between layers (safety score computed at one layer influences decisions at another)

### 10.2 Claims to Narrow

1. **PQC for AI Identity**
   - Do NOT claim PQC for AI agent identity in isolation (Gopher Security describes this)
   - DO claim PQC identity bound to specific governance layer decisions (H(d,pd) score threshold determines identity verification requirements)
   - DO claim PQC identity combined with Sacred Tongue encoding and Concentric Ring topology

2. **BFT for AI Safety**
   - Do NOT claim BFT for AI safety as a general principle (deVadoss describes this)
   - DO claim BFT through Concentric Ring topology with Sacred Tongue-encoded consensus messages
   - DO claim BFT weighted by H(d,pd) safety scores from Poincare Half-Disk geometry

3. **Context Energy**
   - Do NOT claim tokenized AI compute credits (well-established in DePIN/blockchain)
   - DO claim per-operation safety-layer-depth energy accounting using H(d,R) = R^(d^2) cost multiplier
   - DO claim Context Energy consumed during governance-layer traversal (not GPU computation)

### 10.3 Prior Art to Cite in Specification

The following references should be cited in the CIP specification to demonstrate awareness and distinguish our claims:

1. Nickel & Kiela, "Poincare Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations," NeurIPS 2017
2. C3.AI, US Patent 12,111,859 B2, "Enterprise Generative Artificial Intelligence Architecture"
3. Dalrymple et al., "Towards Guaranteed Safe AI," arXiv:2405.06624, May 2024
4. deVadoss, "A Byzantine Fault Tolerance Approach towards AI Safety," arXiv:2504.14668, April 2025
5. NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), August 2024
6. Anthropic, "Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback," arXiv:2212.08073, December 2022
7. SingularityNET AI-DSL project documentation
8. NIST AI RMF 1.0 (NIST AI 100-1), January 2023

### 10.4 CIP-Specific New Matter to Add

The following items from the v4.0.0 roadmap should be included as new matter in the CIP:

1. **Sacred Tongues System** — Six constructed languages with full phonological/grammatical specifications, platform mappings, GeoSeal, and cross-tongue blending
2. **Poincare Half-Disk Model (PHDM)** — Specific H(d,pd) safety score function and its mathematical derivation from hyperbolic geometry
3. **Space Tor** — Telecommunications/space networking extension of the governance architecture (if sufficiently developed by CIP filing)
4. **Concept Blocks** — Domain-agnostic navigation primitives (DECIDE, PLAN, SENSE, STEER, COORDINATE) as governance-layer building blocks
5. **Web Agent Architecture** — SemanticAntivirus, WebPollyPad, Publishers with tongue-transport integration

### 10.5 Freedom to Operate Concerns

1. **C3.AI Patent (US12111859)**: While our architecture is substantially different, a patent attorney should review the specific claim language to ensure no inadvertent overlap with our "layered architecture" claims. The key distinction is that C3.AI's layers are functional (input, supervisory, agent, tool, data, external) while ours are safety/governance layers with mathematical properties.

2. **Meta/Facebook Poincare Embeddings**: No patent found, but should verify through formal patent search. The research was open-sourced, reducing FTO risk, but any internal Meta patent applications covering applications of Poincare geometry to AI systems should be investigated.

3. **Gopher Security**: Blog posts describing PQC for AI agents. Should verify whether Gopher Security has filed any patent applications. If so, timing relative to our priority date is critical.

## Appendix A: SCBE-AETHERMOORE Claim Summary (For Attorney Reference)

The following unique claim elements have NO direct prior art identified:

1. **H(d,pd) = 1/(1+d+2*pd)** bounded safety score function derived from Poincare Half-Disk Model harmonic analysis, applied to AI governance decision-making
2. **H(d,R) = R^(d^2)** exponential cost multiplier for governance layer traversal depth
3. **Sacred Tongues** — six constructed languages (KO, AV, RU, CA, DR, UM) with full phonological/grammatical systems designed for AI fleet governance communication
4. **GeoSeal** — geographic context sealing through Sacred Tongue encoding of governance decisions
5. **Platform-Tongue Mapping** — binding specific Sacred Tongues to specific communication platforms (twitter->KO, linkedin->AV, bluesky->RU, mastodon->CA, wordpress/medium->DR, github->CA, huggingface->UM)
6. **14-Layer Safety Architecture** — the specific L1-L14 structure from Symphonic Cipher through Concentric Ring Policy
7. **Context Energy** — per-operation safety-layer-depth cost accounting using H(d,R) as the cost function
8. **Concentric Ring Policy with Sacred Tongue BFT** — Byzantine fault tolerance through concentric ring topology with Sacred Tongue-encoded consensus messages weighted by H(d,pd) safety scores
9. **PQC-Bound Governance Identity** — Post-quantum cryptographic AI agent identity where identity verification requirements scale with H(d,pd) safety score thresholds
