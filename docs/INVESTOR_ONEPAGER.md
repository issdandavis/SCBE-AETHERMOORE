## Security for AI Agent Fleets

---

## The Problem

**AI agents are becoming autonomous. Security isn't keeping up.**

- LLM-powered agents are making real decisions (code, purchases, access)
- Swarms of drones, robots, and software agents need governance
- Traditional security asks "who are you?" — not "what do you intend?"
- Quantum computers will break current encryption within 10 years

**Today's solutions fail because:**
- Identity-based security can't detect compromised trusted agents
- Linear risk scaling lets attackers estimate exactly what they can get away with
- Single-algorithm crypto is a single point of failure

## The Solution

**SCBE-AETHERMOORE: Math-backed security for autonomous systems**

### What We Do Differently

| Traditional | SCBE-AETHERMOORE |
|-------------|------------------|
| "Are you authorized?" | "Is this behavior normal for your stated intent?" |
| Linear risk scaling | Super-exponential: 2x deviation = 4x cost |
| Single crypto algorithm | Dual-lattice: BOTH must pass |
| Static permissions | Dynamic quorum based on action risk |

### Core Innovation

**Harmonic Risk Amplification:**
```
Cost = R^((deviation × intent)²)
```

Small deviation with bad intent → massive cost.
Large deviation with good intent → manageable.

This creates **asymmetric difficulty**: attackers face exponentially harder problems than legitimate users.
