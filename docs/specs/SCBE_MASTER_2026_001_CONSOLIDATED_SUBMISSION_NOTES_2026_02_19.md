# SCBE MASTER 2026-001 Consolidated Submission Notes

Source: inventor-provided consolidated text drop (ingested February 19, 2026)  
Scope: architecture/index/history claims, updates, references, and AI-conversation catalog.

## 1. Submission Capture Summary

The submission includes the following major blocks:

1. Legacy 13-layer architecture framing and source index.
2. Expanded February 2026 updates indicating transition to 14-layer architecture.
3. PHDM Geometric Skull concept and browser-agent containment roadmap.
4. LWS mathematical specification references.
5. Dual Lattice Cross-Stitch operational details and benchmarks.
6. npm/package/deployment and cloud platform status notes.
7. Claims Audit v4.1 summary and per-experiment outcomes.
8. Unified AI brain manifold narrative (multi-space integration).
9. Future research tracks (4D hyperbolic space, federated octree, DAO governance, DP on manifolds).
10. AI conversation catalog and publication/commercialization status notes.

## 2. Extracted Structure (from submission)

Captured top-level sections:

- Executive summary
- System architecture overview
- Core mathematical framework
- 13-layer security stack
- Six Sacred Tongues protocol
- Source index and links
- Implementation resources/checklists
- February 2026 updates and integrations
- Claims audit v4.1
- Complete AI brain mapping (multi-vectored quasi-space)
- AI conversation catalog integration status

## 3. Normalization Notes (Important)

The submitted text mixes multiple historical states and should be treated as a composite source, not a single canonical spec.

### 3.1 Layer-count conflict

- Legacy sections describe a 13-layer stack.
- Updated sections describe a 14-layer stack with Audio Axis.

Canonical current repo baseline is 14-layer for active docs.

### 3.2 Metric-status conflict

Some statements are operationally reported (downloads, latency, cloud status, valuation) and should be categorized as `reported` unless reproducibly validated in current CI/benchmark runs.

### 3.3 Claims framing

Claims Audit v4.1 includes mixed statuses (`proven`, `disproven`, `gap`, `overstated`) and should be preserved as experiment-context evidence, not generalized unconditional claims.

## 4. Immediate Reuse Targets

This submission should feed:

- `docs/SCBE_AETHERMOORE_TECH_DECK_V5_COMPLETE.md` (already active consolidation target)
- patent preparation annexes (claims evidence matrix)
- map-room handoff/state logs for roundtable distribution
- training ingestion bundles for multi-AI coordination

## 5. Reconciliation Backlog

1. Create a strict `historical vs canonical` matrix (13-layer vs 14-layer artifacts).
2. Build a `reported vs verified` table for all performance/security numbers.
3. Attach experiment provenance IDs to each claims-audit statement.
4. Normalize repository/source links to currently active repos and artifact IDs.
5. Publish a machine-readable manifest for this submission block.

## 6. Ingestion Metadata

- Ingest date: 2026-02-19
- Ingest method: manual transcript consolidation
- Intended route: map-room + multi-AI content sync + cloud autosync
- Status: captured for roundtable review
