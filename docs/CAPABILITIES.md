# SCBE-AETHERMOORE Capabilities

This document summarizes what the product can do today, how to access key features, and what to expect from each subsystem.

## Core Security Engine

- **14-layer hyperbolic pipeline** for risk scoring and decision gating (ALLOW / QUARANTINE / DENY).
- **Poincaré ball geometry** with Möbius transforms and bounded risk amplification.
- **Harmonic wall** and spectral coherence checks to resist incremental adversarial drift.
- **Decision telemetry** for auditability and forensic analysis.

## Cryptography & Envelopes

- **RWP envelopes** for sealed payloads with integrity and tamper detection.
- **AAD binding** for contextual integrity (request metadata participates in verification).
- **Replay protection** with nonce tracking and failure-to-noise behavior.
- **Post-quantum hooks** in the protocol surface for ML-KEM / ML-DSA integration.

## Sacred Tongues + GeoSeal

- **Six Sacred Tongues** tokenizer for 6x256 vocabulary with bijective encode/decode.
- **Cross-tongue translation** with prefix-stable token flows.
- **GeoSeal envelopes** for context-bound sealing and safe unsealing.
- **CLI tooling** for encode/decode, xlate, blend/unblend, and geoseal operations.

## Fleet & Governance

- **Fleet orchestration** with weighted consensus (Roundtable).
- **Rogue detection** and governance tiers for multi-agent safety.
- **Replay guard integration** for distributed enforcement.

## API & Integrations

- **FastAPI gateway** for validating actions and running scenarios.
- **TypeScript + Python SDKs** for embedding the pipeline in apps.
- **Cross-language parity tests** to validate geometric operations.

## Observability & Telemetry

- **Structured metrics** for envelope creation, verification, and replay rejections.
- **Benchmark harness** for latency and throughput checks.
- **Coverage & audit artifacts** (JSON + HTML) generated by test runs.

## Deployment & Packaging

- **npm package** (`scbe-aethermoore`) with TypeScript artifacts and CLI wrapper.
- **Python-first CLI** with a Node wrapper (`scbe.js`) that launches Python.
- **CLI ZIP** included in the npm package for offline distribution.
- **Docker and AWS** composition files for API and demo deployment.

## Demos & Examples

- Fleet scenario runner
- Sacred Tongue demo
- Spiralverse story demo

See `DEMOS.md` for curated demo scripts and expected outputs.

## Known Constraints

- The CLI wrapper requires **Python 3.x** available on PATH (or `PYTHON` env var).
- Post-quantum backends depend on optional native libraries.
- Some property tests are sensitive to floating-point precision at the boundary.
