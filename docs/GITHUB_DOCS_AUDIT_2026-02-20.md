# GitHub Docs Audit (Branch Scope)

Date: 2026-02-20  
Branch: `feat/aetherbrowse-v0.1-watchers-locks`

## Objective

Verify that the primary docs produced in this workstream are committed and visible on GitHub branch scope.

## Verified Present

- `docs/CHANGE_NOTES_SPIRAL_ENGINE_2026-02-20.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE_SPIRAL_ENGINE_OMEGA_WATCHERS.md`
- `docs/research/AETHERMOOR_SPIRAL_ENGINE_MVP.md`
- `docs/WEB_RESEARCH_TRAINING_PIPELINE.md`
- `docs/research/SHEAF_CONSENSUS_GATE.md`
- `docs/research/MULTI_MODEL_MODAL_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`
- `docs/EXPERIMENT_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/LANGUAGE_GUARDRAILS.md`
- `docs/MOBILE_AUTONOMY_RUNBOOK.md`

## Verification Method

- Branch file existence checks against remote ref:
  - `origin/feat/aetherbrowse-v0.1-watchers-locks`

## Notes

- Audit is branch-specific and does not assert default-branch merge state.
- Recommended follow-up: open PR and merge after review, then rerun same check on default branch.
