Status: VERIFIED / Patent Pending (USPTO #63/961,403)

<!-- Unsupported block type: callout -->
SCBE-AETHERMOORE is a Hyperbolic Governance Engine designed to secure autonomous AI systems. Unlike traditional security which relies on linear access rules, this system maps "intent" into a 14-layer hyperbolic geometry.

Core Philosophy: Make adversarial actions geometrically impossible, not just computationally difficult.

---

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 The Core Innovation

The Harmonic Wall:

As an agent's intent drifts from verified truth (center), the computational cost to execute that intent scales super-exponentially:

```javascript
H(d, R) = R^(d²)
```

Where:

- H = Energy cost

- d = Dimensional depth (verification layers)

- R = Radial distance from trusted center

## 2. The Cognitive Core: PHDM Architecture

### 2.1 The Quasicrystal Lattice

The "Brain" of the system replaces static neural weights with dynamic geometric states.

Structure:

- 6D → 3D Projection: Quasicrystal lattice based on icosahedral symmetry

- Golden Ratio Foundation: φ (phi) = 1.618033...

- Non-Periodic Design: Prevents crystallinity (infinite loops)

Function:

- Enforces non-repeating cognitive patterns

- Resists adversarial manipulation

- Provides 16 distinct polyhedral "cognitive zones"

### 2.3 Hamiltonian Control Flow (CFI)

Valid Logic Path Requirements:

- Single-Visit: Each reasoning node visited exactly once (prevents loops)

- Energy Conservation: Thought processes violating symplectic momentum are terminated

- Topological Obstruction Detection: Impossible logical jumps are geometrically prevented

Security Properties:

- ✅ 99% ROP attack detection rate

- ✅ Zero runtime overhead (validation at compile/planning time)

- ✅ Hallucination prevention via enforced logical consistency

- ✅ Adaptive resilience (Phason Shifting)

### 2.4 Phason Shifting (Defense Mechanism)

The system can rotate the 6D projection angle, instantly scrambling lattice connections:

- Acts as Geometric Key Rotation

- Invalidates attacker's neural pathway maps

- Provides dynamic resilience without downtime

## 3. The Security Physics: SCBE & GeoSeal

### 3.1 The 14-Layer Pipeline

Data traverses 14 mathematical transformations to verify integrity:

Layers 1-4 (Embedding):

- Complex Context → Realification → Poincaré Ball Projection

- Maps intent vectors into hyperbolic space

Layer 5 (The Invariant):

- Calculates Hyperbolic Distance (d_H)

- This metric never changes regardless of attack

Layers 6-11 (Verification):

- Topological CFI, Swarm Coordination, Langues Metric

- Multi-dimensional validation checks

Layer 12 (The Harmonic Wall):

- Enforces scaling law H(d,R) = R^(d²)

- Creates computational "event horizon" for adversarial actions

Layer 13 (Audit):

- Immutable decision logging

- Forensic reconstruction capability

Layer 14 (Audio Axis):

- Analyzes "sound" of data via FFT

- Detects harmonic drift indicating anomalies

### 3.2 GeoSeal: Dual-Space Manifold

Access control determined by intersection of two geometric shapes:

1. The Sphere (S^n): Behavior

- Represents AI mind-state

- Dynamic, changes with actions

2. The Hypercube (ℝ^m): Policy

- Represents rules and tiers

- Static, defined by administrators

Time Dilation:

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

### 3.3 Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Dual-Lattice Consensus:

- Key Exchange: ML-KEM (Kyber768)

- Signatures: ML-DSA (Dilithium3)

- Key Derivation: SHA3-256/HKDF

Security Benefit: Attacker must break BOTH algorithms simultaneously

### 4.2 The Langues Weighting System (LWS)

Total weight calculation:

```javascript
W_total = Σ (w_i × e^(φ×i))
```

Governance Integration:

- Phase Delta monitoring: Large rotations trigger scrutiny

- Weight Ratio tracking: Security escalation detection

- Cross-tokenization attestation: Proof of valid transitions

### 4.3 Spectral Fingerprinting

Process:

1. Feistel Network: Symmetric encryption structure

2. FFT Transform: Converts data to frequency domain

3. Cooley-Tukey Algorithm: Efficient real-time processing

Harmonic Verification:

- Valid commands resonate at specific harmonic intervals

- Temporal coherence enforced (time-window validation)

- Fail-to-Noise: Threats decay into high-entropy random noise
