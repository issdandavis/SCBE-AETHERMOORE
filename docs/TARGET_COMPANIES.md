## Your Differentiators (For Conversations)

When talking to any of these companies, lead with:

1. **"We prevent AI agent misbehavior mathematically, not heuristically"**
   - Hyperbolic geometry gives provable bounds
   - Intent is part of the cost function

2. **"Our PQC is dual-lattice, not single algorithm"**
   - ML-KEM AND ML-DSA required
   - Temporal binding prevents replay

3. **"Bad actors face exponentially worse costs"**
   - H = R^(d²) means 2x deviation = 4x cost, not 2x
   - Attackers can't incrementally probe

4. **"Already implemented, not theoretical"**
   - 30K+ lines of code
   - 1K+ tests
   - Working demos

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Pick 3 companies from Tier 1-2 to research deeply
2. [ ] Find LinkedIn connections to engineering leads
3. [ ] Draft outreach message (I can help)
4. [ ] Identify 1 conference to submit to
