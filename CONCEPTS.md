# SCBE Concepts (Canonical)

This glossary is intentionally conservative. It defines only terms used in canonical specification and implementation surfaces.

## Core identity
- **Project**: SCBE-AETHERMOORE
- **Primary author**: Issac Davis
- **Canonical acronym**: **SCBE**
- **Canonical expansion**: **Spectral Context Bound Encryption**

## Terms

### SCBE (Spectral Context Bound Encryption)
A protocol and implementation framework for context-bound cryptographic governance over AI/tool execution flows.

### Entropic Defense Engine
The governance subsystem responsible for enforcing risk controls, escalation rules, and denial behavior under uncertainty.

### AI Governance
Policy + quorum + lineage controls that decide whether requested actions are allowed, denied, or escalated.

### Spectral Governance
A class of governance checks that evaluate interaction structure/signals (e.g., graph/spectral features) to detect anomalies or collusion indicators.

### Canonical vs Experimental
- **Canonical**: files linked from `SPEC.md`.
- **Experimental**: exploratory code/docs not authoritative for protocol semantics.

## Interpretation rule
If documentation disagrees, defer to `SPEC.md` and release-tagged test vectors.


- **Genesis Closure**: Canonical requirement that creation (nonexistent -> existent) is authorized via Sacred Eggs theorem checks, complementing runtime action authorization.
