# ClayBot Headless IDE Plan

## Objective
Build local-first ClayBot/PollyBot headless coding workflow with switchboard lanes.

## Work Breakdown
1. Define scope and guardrails.
2. Implement baseline artifacts.
3. Validate execution path.
4. Capture memory notes and next actions.

## Governance
- Role separation: planner -> coder -> reviewer -> memory.
- Turnstile decisions enforced per task.
- Outputs are logged through HYDRA Switchboard.
