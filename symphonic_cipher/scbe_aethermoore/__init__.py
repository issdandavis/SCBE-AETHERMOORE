SCBE-AETHERMOORE: Phase-Breath Hyperbolic Governance System

A 9D Quantum Hyperbolic Manifold Memory for AI governance where:
- Truthful actions trace smooth geodesics
- Lies/threats manifest as geometric discontinuities (snaps)
- Governance is geometric shape, not rule-based policy

Core Components:
- manifold/: 9D Poincaré ball with hyperbolic geometry
- governance/: Phase-breath transforms and snap protocol
- quantum/: PQC integration via liboqs
- layers/: 14-layer mapping system

Central Thesis:
    AI safety = geometric + temporal + entropic + quantum continuity
    Invalid states physically cannot exist on the manifold
