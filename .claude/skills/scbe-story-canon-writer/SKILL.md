# SCBE Story Canon Writer

Use this workflow to keep creative prose and system architecture consistent.

## Workflow

1. Define target chapter purpose.
2. Select canon anchors for that chapter.
3. Draft scene flow first, then insert system beats.
4. Keep character voice stable while introducing technical mechanics.
5. Run canon consistency pass before finalizing.

## Canon Anchors

1. Sacred Tongues and tokenizer behavior.
2. Governance states and turnstile semantics.
3. Hyperbolic or boundary mechanics used in-system.
4. Existing named entities, ranks, and artifacts.

## Output Contract

1. `chapter_draft.md` with chapter ID.
2. `canon_map.json` mapping scenes to system anchors.
3. `continuity_flags.md` listing unresolved canon conflicts.

## Guardrails

1. Do not introduce mechanics that contradict locked canon.
2. Mark speculative additions as provisional until approved.
3. Keep litRPG overlays readable and sparse.
