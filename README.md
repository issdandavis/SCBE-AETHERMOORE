## Overview

SCBE-AETHERMOORE is a novel authorization framework that uses **hyperbolic geometry** and **topological control-flow integrity** to secure AI agents and autonomous systems against sophisticated attacks including replay, prompt injection, and privilege escalation.

### Key Innovations

- **Poincare Ball Trust Space**: Authorization decisions computed in hyperbolic geometry where distance from origin = trust level
- **9-Dimensional State Vector**: Continuous monitoring of context, intent, entropy, and behavioral coherence
- **13-Layer Security Pipeline**: From initialization through CFI verification to final audit
- **Fail-to-Noise Oracle**: Attacks produce indistinguishable random outputs (no information leakage)
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Lattice-based cryptographic primitives
