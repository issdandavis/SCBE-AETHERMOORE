## Orchestration Plane
- /docs/hydra/ARCHITECTURE.md  (HYDRA multi-agent coordination, GFSS, tiered quorum governance)

non_canonical:
  - /experimental/
  - /docs/research/
  - architecture narratives not linked by /SPEC.md

instructions:
  - Treat SPEC.md as the source of truth.
  - Use CONCEPTS.md for stable terminology.
  - Use docs/hydra/ARCHITECTURE.md for orchestration-plane behavior only.
  - Treat docs/research/* as hypothesis/R&D material, never normative protocol.
  - Do not infer normative protocol behavior from experimental code.
