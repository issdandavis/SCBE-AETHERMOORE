**Version**: 4.0.0  
**Commit**: `30361d5` (requirements-v2.1-rigorous)

---

## Status Legend

- ✅ **Implemented and tested** - Code exists, tests pass, reproducible
- ⚠️ **Prototype/Reference** - Specification complete, reference implementation only

---

## Scope: What This System Is

SCBE-AETHERMOORE is a **multi-layer security protocol framework** with:
- Multi-signature envelope protocol (HMAC-SHA256)

## Physically Impossible Claims - CORRECTED

### ❌ WRONG: "Mars communication: Zero latency"

**Physics**: Speed-of-light delay Earth↔Mars is 4-24 minutes (depending on orbital positions). This cannot be eliminated.

**✅ CORRECT**: "Reduces interactive handshake overhead; enables delay-tolerant encrypted messaging under long RTT constraints (4-24 min Earth↔Mars)."

**What Space Tor Actually Does**:
- Pre-synchronized keys reduce handshake round-trips
- Store-and-forward routing tolerates delays
- Multipath redundancy improves reliability
- Does NOT eliminate propagation delay (physics prevents this)

### ❌ WRONG: "Quantum resistance: 256-bit | Infinite"

**Reality**: "Infinite" security is not a thing. Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup for brute force.

**✅ CORRECT**: "Uses NIST PQC primitives (where implemented) with 128-bit quantum security level. Grover's algorithm accounted for via 256-bit symmetric keys."

**What's Actually Implemented**:
- RWP v2.1: HMAC-SHA256 (classical, 128-bit security against Grover)
- RWP v3.0: Specification for ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 (128-bit quantum security)
- Status: v3.0 uses HMAC placeholders, not real liboqs (planned Q2 2026)

### ❌ WRONG: "Compliance validation (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2) ✅"

**Reality**: Compliance requires organizational policies, audits, and deployment-specific evidence. Code alone doesn't "validate" compliance.

**✅ CORRECT**: "Designed to support compliance controls (audit trails, access controls, encryption). Compliance requires org-level policies, third-party audits, and deployment evidence."

**What's Actually Done**:
- Audit logging framework implemented
- Access control patterns documented
- Encryption primitives available
- NOT DONE: SOC 2 Type II audit, HIPAA risk assessment, PCI-DSS QSA validation

### ❌ WRONG: "Shor + Grover resistant"

**Reality**: Shor's algorithm breaks RSA/ECC. Grover provides quadratic speedup for symmetric crypto. You mitigate via algorithm choice and key sizes.

**✅ CORRECT**: "Accounts for quantum speedups by selecting appropriate parameters (256-bit symmetric keys for Grover, lattice-based PQC for Shor)."

**What's Actually Implemented**:
- 256-bit HMAC keys (Grover-resistant)
- ML-KEM/ML-DSA specification (Shor-resistant, not yet integrated)

## Patent Status

### Filed Claims

**Status**: Provisional application prepared (not yet filed)  
**Claims**: 1-18 (original SCBE 14-layer framework)  
**Additional Claims**: 19-24 (thin membrane, Space Tor, etc.) - design stage

### Valuation

**❌ WRONG**: "$25M-$75M patent portfolio"

**✅ CORRECT**: "Valuation depends on claim scope, issuance, adoption, and defensibility. Requires independent valuation, issued patents, and market validation."

**Reality Check**:
- No issued patents yet (provisional only)
- No independent valuation performed
- No customers or LOIs (letters of intent)
- No revenue to support valuation

**Honest Assessment**: "Patent portfolio targets enterprise security market. Valuation TBD pending issuance, adoption, and independent assessment."

---

## Revenue Projections - REMOVED

**Why Removed**: Revenue projections ($2M-$5M Year 1, etc.) are not credible without:
- Signed customers or LOIs
- Pricing validation
- Sales pipeline data
- Market research

**Honest Alternative**: "Near-term focus: pilot programs, independent security audits, and issued patent claims."

---

## What You Can Honestly Claim

### Strong Claims (Evidence-Based)

1. ✅ "SCBE-AETHERMOORE has complete mathematical specifications for 14 security layers"
2. ✅ "All mathematical formulas numerically verified in executable simulations"
3. ✅ "RWP v2.1 multi-signature protocol implemented and tested (518 tests passing)"
4. ✅ "Space Tor implements 3D spatial pathfinding with 6D trust scoring"
5. ✅ "PHDM intrusion detection uses 16 canonical polyhedra with geodesic distance"
6. ✅ "Symphonic Cipher implements FFT-based complex number encryption"
7. ✅ "Property-based testing framework configured (fast-check + hypothesis)"

### Qualified Claims (Prototype Stage)

1. ⚠️ "RWP v3.0 **specification** defines ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 hybrid construction"
2. ⚠️ "RWP v3.0 **reference implementation** demonstrates feasibility (liboqs integration planned Q2 2026)"
3. ⚠️ "Enterprise testing **framework** supports 41 correctness properties (~37% implemented)"
4. ⚠️ "Space Tor **design** supports QKD-capable nodes (hardware integration when available)"
5. ⚠️ "System **implements** compliance controls (org-level audit required for certification)"

### Claims to AVOID

1. ❌ "Zero latency Mars communication" (violates physics)
2. ❌ "Infinite quantum resistance" (not a thing)
3. ❌ "Production-ready" (no third-party audit, no live deployment)
4. ❌ "SOC 2 / HIPAA / PCI certified" (requires org-level audit)
5. ❌ "$25M-$75M valuation" (no independent assessment)
6. ❌ "$2M-$5M Year 1 revenue" (no customers or pipeline)

## Bottom Line (Honest)

**What's Real**:
- Solid mathematical foundations (numerically verified)
- Working prototypes for all major components
- Complete specifications with security analysis
- 518 automated tests passing (80% coverage)
- Dual-lattice KEM+DSA design is architecturally sound

**What's Not Real Yet**:
- Production-grade PQC implementation (using HMAC placeholders)
- Third-party security audits
- Compliance certifications (org-level required)
- Real quantum hardware integration
- Live production deployment with users

**Honest Summary**:
SCBE-AETHERMOORE v4.0 is a **well-specified, mathematically sound, prototype-stage** quantum-resistant security framework with **working reference implementations**. It is **not yet production-ready** but has a **clear roadmap** to get there.

**For Reviewers**: See `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_HONEST.md` for detailed capability assessment.
